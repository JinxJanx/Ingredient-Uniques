Ingredient Uniques Resource Pack Notes

This resource pack is intended to help players see ingredient drops better.
Typically a Vindicator bracelet is used to help gather ingredients and help
prevent missing a drop. A crafted bracelet can achieve 3x the amount of the
Vindicator's loot bonus. Whether using a Vindicator or not, this resource
pack should help see drops.

- Items are scaled up/down for visual assist (similar to chests in Wynncraft)
- Some items are rotated back, to better see them from an elevated position
- Some items have texture swaps helping the identification of overused textures
